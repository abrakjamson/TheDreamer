# The Dreamer: An Experiment of Consciousness
There are very few established and verifiable markers of consciousness, and fewer still that today's LLM + chat products do not meet.
*The Dreamer* sets out to meet the remaining aspects of consciousness.
So far, I argue it meets the criteria established by the theories of:
* Functionalism
* Integrated Information Theory
* Global Workspace Theory
* Higher Order Theory

I also argue that *The Dreamer* shows basic levels of:
* Self-awareness
* Subjective experience
* Integration of information
* Adaptability

It does not yet show Intentionality, but I'll add that next.

## Argument answers
### The Dreamer doesn't have true sensory input
I could easily add listening to the microphone instead of randomly choosing words. Would you still make this argument?
### The Dreamer only simulates consciousness
This could be. Can you show that you are not a brain-in-a-vat, or that we do not all live in a simulation?
### Only biological brains can have consciousness
Why?
### This code isn't complicated enough
I assure you that the LLMs it runs upon are plenty complicated. How many neurons will equal consciousness?
